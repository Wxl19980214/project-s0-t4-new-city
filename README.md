Used to compare different cities for people looking for a new home, while also comparing different houses/apartments/etc. The app would detail cost of living, crime rates, and the average income of specified job(s) in the city, and cost/rent of the homes. Our app will genereate a list of possible candidates according to user's preference. 

We are going to use Spring Boot to create this project. 

Roles:
- User: User can input certain data such as averge income, working field, family, age, weather 
        entertainment, and our app will generate a list of possible candidates and rank them based on user input data.
- Admin: Inputs and maintains static data gathered from online databases.
