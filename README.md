# project-s0-t4-new-city

Ari	Brian	Xilin	Steven

Used to compare different cities for people looking for a new home, while also comparing different houses/apartments/etc. The app would detail cost of living, crime rates, and the average income of specified job(s) in the city, and cost/rent of the homes.
Some possible sources of data are data.gov and data.ca.gov

As a suggestion, the first few team agreements, might be these:

1)When one of us is absent for an unavoidable reason, we will let the other team members know on the team slack channel, in advance when possible, as soon as possible afterwards when not.

2)We will each try to keep such absences to a minimum.

3)Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team member(s) what they missed and help them get back up to speed.

4)We will all do our best to contribute to the teams success.

Questions:

When the team works together, what should the atmosphere/culture/planning/grooming process be?
- Talk about it and then vote.

When differences/challenges arise how do you want to be and how do you want to address them?

- Each of us should present their view on the problem and we should all listen.
- If we still do not solve it, we could all do more research on the topic and later vote on it.
