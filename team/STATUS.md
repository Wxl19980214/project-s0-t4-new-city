## Sprint Goal for Monday 04/27 through Monday 05/04

Completion of MVP

## Brief description of MVP

(Describe what your MVP does for a user; set the expectations not too high and not too low. This should be written 
in informal language; the audience is someone, e.g. a fellow CS48 student, or any random UCSB student, that is going
to try out your MVP app.   Include everything they need to know, or a pointer to what they need to know, so that
they know what to do with your app.    For example, if the app plays the "mafia game" or "poker", include enough
detail of the game *or* a *link to a description of your game* so that a user will understand your app.)

The goal of our app is for users to be able to find a county in California to live based on their preferences. In our MVP users should be able to see a list with the counties of California ranked by average income.

* Team has completed production app placeholder

## MVP Status

* Team is on track to complete all stories for MVP by noon a week from Thursday (05/07/2020)

What obstacles remain to completing MVP:
* We will most likely need a database, and we don't have experience with databases.

Support that would be helpful from course staff to completing MVP
* We might need help to upload from a csv file to a database and then to get the information from the database to the web app.

## Other important things

(Unresolved application design issues)
* For our last iterations we will be incorporating more and better design, so I think that later in the quarter we will encounter more design issues.

(Unresolved technical issues)

* to do.

(Key obstacles to future iterations (beyond MVP))
* We might later need help with all the sorting parts for our later iterations, since the user should eventually be able to sort according to many inputs.

## Sprint Goal for 05/12-05/21
  
Which of the 10 powerful questions did you ask?
  
  What would need to happen while working on this Sprint Goal that would be cause for celebration?
  
  Ari: Recommendation feature
  Brian: Complete issues
  Steven: Link county names to wikipedia
  Xilin: Comparsion feature
  
  We eventually agreed that the cause of celebration would be all of the team member work together to get 
  recommendation feature finished.

Describe your sprint goal here.

  Have recommendation feature ready by demo day. (Recommendation feature: We will allow users to answer a survey 
  to indicate their preferences, and according to that we will find suitable counties for users.)
  
Describe briefly how you came up with that goal.
  
  Because first it is an important feature for users as the users don't have to look at all counties but the ones 
  they are interested about. Second, it is a challenging problem and we want to do it now so we don't leave it at 
  the end of quarter when we have finals coming. 
  
## Discussion of previous Sprint Goal
  
Briefly: was the sprint goal acheived?  Was it too ambitious?  Too modest? 

  Yes. It was a little bit modest because we could have put more effort and time into it.
