## Sprint Goal for Monday 04/27 through Monday 05/04

Completion of MVP

## Brief description of MVP

(Describe what your MVP does for a user; set the expectations not too high and not too low. This should be written 
in informal language; the audience is someone, e.g. a fellow CS48 student, or any random UCSB student, that is going
to try out your MVP app.   Include everything they need to know, or a pointer to what they need to know, so that
they know what to do with your app.    For example, if the app plays the "mafia game" or "poker", include enough
detail of the game *or* a *link to a description of your game* so that a user will understand your app.)

The goal of our app is for users to be able to find a county in California to live based on their preferences. In our MVP users should be able to see a list with the counties of California ranked by average income.

* Team has completed production app placeholder

## MVP Status

* Team is on track to complete all stories for MVP by noon a week from Thursday (05/07/2020)

What obstacles remain to completing MVP:
* We will most likely need a database, and we don't have experience with databases.

Support that would be helpful from course staff to completing MVP
* We might need help to upload from a csv file to a database and then to get the information from the database to the web app.

## Other important things

(Unresolved application design issues)
* For our last iterations we will be incorporating more and better design, so I think that later in the quarter we will encounter more design issues.

(Unresolved technical issues)

* to do.

(Key obstacles to future iterations (beyond MVP))
* We might later need help with all the sorting parts for our later iterations, since the user should eventually be able to sort according to many inputs.
